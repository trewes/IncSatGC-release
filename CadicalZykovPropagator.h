    // The following two functions are used to add external clauses to the
    // solver during the CDCL loop. The external clause is added
    // literal-by-literal and learned by the solver as an irredundant
    // (original) input clause. The clause can be arbitrary, but if it is
    // root-satisfied or tautology, the solver will ignore it without learning
    // it. Root-falsified literals are eagerly removed from the clause.
    // Falsified clauses trigger conflict analysis, propagating clauses
    // trigger propagation. In case chrono is 0, the solver backtracks to
    // propagate the new literal on the right decision level, otherwise it
    // potentially will be an out-of-order assignment on the current level.
    // Unit clauses always (unless root-satisfied, see above) trigger
    // backtracking (independently from the value of the chrono option and
    // independently from being falsified or satisfied or unassigned) to level
    // 0. Empty clause (or root falsified clause, see above) makes the problem
    // unsat and stops the search immediately. A literal 0 must close the
    // clause.
    //
    // The external propagator indicates that there is a clause to add.
    // The parameter of the function allows the user to indicate that how
    // 'forgettable' is the external clause. Further, there is a member-parameter
    // called 'is_tainting' that indicates if the external clauses are irredundant
    // (almost always they are, see below the rare exceptions).
    // There are overall four possible scenarios defined by these two Boolean flags:
    // - Non-Forgettable & Tainting Clause [default value].
    //    - Policy to Forget: The clause will not be deleted, unless it is
    //      directly implied by some of the other irredundant clauses (e.g. root
    //      satisfied).
    //    - Tainting: The clause will be considered as irredundant and thus the
    //      literals of it will be tainted and might trigger restore steps
    //      (except frozen literals).
    //    - Example: It is always safe and correct to use this clause type.
    // - Forgettable & Tainting Clause.
    //    - Policy to Forget: The clause will be considered for deletion during
    //      clause database reduction rounds.
    //    - Tainting: The clause will be considered as irredundant and thus the
    //      literals of it will be tainted and might trigger restore steps (except
    //      frozen literals).
    //    - Example usage: Theory lemmas in SMT solvers. Anything that is
    //      irredundant from the SAT perspective (hence must be considered for
    //      tainting), but allowed to be deleted because the external propagator
    //      (e.g. theory solver) can always re-derive it.
    // - Forgettable & Not-Tainting Clause.
    //    - Policy to Forget: The clause will be considered for deletion during
    //      clause database reduction rounds.
    //    - Tainting: The clause is assumed to be derivable in propositional
    //      logic from the current set of irredundant and redundant clauses (i.e.
    //      (\phi \land \rho) \implies C, as in the side condition of Learn- in
    //      incremental inprocessing), therefore the literals of it are not
    //      tainted and do not trigger restore steps.
    //    - Example usage: Use it ONLY to share learned clauses between parallel
    //      SAT solvers. It is NOT correct to use this clause type unless the
    //      clause is indeed directly derivable by the SAT solver alone.
    // - Non-Forgettable & Non-Tainting Clause:
    //    - Policy to Forget: The clause will not be deleted, unless it is
    //      directly implied by some of the other irredundant clauses (e.g. root
    //      satisfied).
    //    - Redundancy: The clause is assumed to be derivable in propositional
    //      logic from the current set of irredundant and redundant clauses (i.e.
    //      (\phi \land \rho) \implies C, as in the side condition of Learn- in
    //      incremental inprocessing), therefore the literals of it are not
    //      tainted and do not trigger restore steps.
    //    - Example usage: Same as previous case, the only difference is that the
    //      clauses will be kept around (can be useful in cases where their
    //      derivation was expensive).
    //
    //
    // Reason clauses of external propagation steps are assumed to be forgettable,
    // and tainting by default. Use parameter 'reason_forgettable' to change it.
    //
    // DISCLAIMER: Any tainting clause is correct to be added ONLY if it is
    // guaranteed that the SAT solver uses only RUP-based clause addition
    // techniques (so no BVA) and the literals are either tainted or frozen.
    // See our Incremental Inprocessing SAT'19 paper for more details on it.
    //
    // The naming of the clause types will might change later (to coordinate
    // with IPASIR-2).
